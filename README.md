## OpenAI's CLIP vector calculation for C#

This project currently shows how to calculate CLIP vectors for a picture in C# with the ONNX Runtime.
Feel free to copy and paste code from here to your own project.

When I get around to it, this project might be upgraded and become an installable library.

The weights and details of this implementation have been adapted from: [josephrocca/openai-clip-js](https://github.com/josephrocca/openai-clip-js).
